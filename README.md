Getting Started
To run the app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Install the dependencies by running npm install.
Start the development server with npm start.
Features
Fetches data from the API endpoint and displays it in a table.
Edit existing entities and update data on the server.
Delete entities and remove them from the table and server.
Create new entities using a popup form.
How It Works
The app uses the useApiData custom hook to fetch data from the API endpoint specified. The fetched data is then rendered using the DataRenderer component.

useApiData Hook
The useApiData hook is responsible for fetching data from the API. It takes the API endpoint as an argument and returns the fetched data and loading state. If there's an error during the data fetch, it will be logged to the console.

DataRenderer Component
The DataRenderer component receives the API endpoint as a prop and uses the useApiData hook to fetch the data. It also handles editing, deleting, and creating entities.

Editing Data
When you click the "Edit" button for a particular entity, a popup appears with editable fields for each property of the entity. You can modify the values and click the "Save" button to update the data on the server and in the table.

Deleting Data
Clicking the "Delete" button for an entity will remove it from the table and delete it from the server.

Creating New Entity
Clicking the "+" button at the bottom-right corner of the page will open a popup with input fields to create a new entity. After filling in the details, click the "Create" button to add the new entity to the table and the server.

Styling
The app is styled using Tailwind CSS. It uses a responsive table layout and popup modals for editing and creating entities. Buttons have different colors for visual cues, and the "+" button is fixed to the bottom-right corner for easy access.

Customization
You can customize the role variable in the DataRenderer component to control the actions available for different user roles.

Remember to replace the API endpoint in the App component with your actual API endpoint.

Feel free to modify the styles in tailwind.config.js to match your project's theme.

Additional Features (Proposed)
Pagination: Implement pagination for the table to handle large datasets efficiently.
Sorting: Add sorting functionality to the table headers for easy data analysis.
Search: Add a search bar to filter data based on specific criteria.
Error Handling: Enhance error handling and display appropriate messages to users.
Data Validation: Implement client-side validation for input fields in the create/edit forms.
Loading State: Show loading indicators during data fetching to improve user experience.
